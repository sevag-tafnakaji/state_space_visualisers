# state_space_visualisers.

This project will include a simulator for state space models, as well as solvers for Riccati equations for the use of kalman filters and LQR controllers for the models.

The motivation for this project is that control systems are most easily solved using MATLAB, but not everyone can afford the MATLAB license. This simply python package should emulate that as closely as possible.
